## Overview

This proyect has been created to practice Reat knowledge.

You can add a new task by clicking the button. At the botton list ahow you all the added tasks.

There are three columns: all tasks, active tasks and completed tasks.

When you completed a task, check it and it will appear in completed tasks column (or all tasks).

Also, the tasks are saved to local storaged. When you reload the page it will reappear.

The page should be responsive:
